My fiancee and his sister both got the tonkatsu ramen. I got the Shoryu Ganso Tonkatsu, which is their signature ramen. I think it's really difficult to f*ck up ramen, so of course, the ramen was really really good. I also got the virgin yuzu mojito, which was tart, but I liked it. I couldn't tell if it was just me but the waitress was a bit short with us. Maybe I was just imagining it. Regardless, I can see why this place gets good reviews.
